# Shopbonus API reference

Machine-readable contract: [`openapi.yaml`](openapi.yaml) (OpenAPI 3.1). This page is the readable companion: every endpoint shows an example request and a **real response captured from a running server**.

## Documentation rule (mandatory for every agent)

1. Every route under `/api/v1` must have an entry in `openapi.yaml` and in this file. `tests/Feature/Api/OpenApiCoverageTest.php` fails the build if a route is missing, has no example request (`x-codeSamples`), or has a response without an example.
2. Example responses must be **captured from a real running server**, never written by hand. Run `php artisan serve`, call the endpoint with `curl -i`, and paste the output. Strip `Date`, `Host`, `Connection`, `X-Powered-By`, `Cache-Control`, `Vary` and CORS headers.
3. Use seeded or obviously fake data only. Never paste real customer data, tokens, voucher codes or secrets. Replace a real secret header value with a `<NAME_OF_ENV_VAR>` placeholder in the request.
4. Record what you captured against (for example "local MySQL 8 + Redis, commit `abc1234`").
5. For an error status the endpoint cannot yet produce, use an envelope rendered through the real app kernel, and say so.

## Conventions

| Topic | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Base path | `/api/v1`. A breaking change gets `/api/v2`; never change a released v1 contract in place. |
| Format | JSON only. `Accept: application/json` is forced on API routes, so auth failures never redirect to HTML. |
| Correlation | Every response has `X-Request-Id`. Send your own (8–128 chars `A-Za-z0-9._-`) to trace across systems; anything else is replaced by a UUIDv7. The same ID appears in server logs. |
| Errors | One envelope, below. Framework messages are fixed per status. A 404 is identical whether a record is missing or belongs to another workspace. |
| Money | Integer minor units plus explicit `currency`/`unit`. Never floats. |
| Rate limit | `API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` (default 60) per user, or per IP when unauthenticated. Headers: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `Retry-After` on 429. |
| CORS | Only origins in `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, with credentials (for the Sanctum SPA). Exposed headers: `X-Request-Id`, `Retry-After`. |

### Error envelope

```json
{
  "error": {
    "status": 422,
    "code": "validation_failed",
    "message": "The given data was invalid.",
    "request_id": "01a168bd-f895-73d8-881b-0f4ac0620658",
    "fields": { "email": ["The email field must be a valid email address."] }
  }
}
```

`fields` appears only on 422. `details` appears only on domain errors that define it. On 5xx with `APP_DEBUG=true` (never in production) a `debug` block is added.

| Status | `code` | Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `bad_request` | The request could not be processed. |
| 401 | `unauthenticated` | Authentication is required. |
| 403 | `forbidden` | You are not allowed to perform this action. |
| 404 | `not_found` | The requested resource was not found. |
| 405 | `method_not_allowed` | This method is not allowed for the requested resource. |
| 409 | `conflict` (or a domain code) | Domain-specific |
| 415 | `unsupported_media_type` | The request content type is not supported. |
| 419 | `csrf_token_mismatch` | The session or CSRF token has expired. Refresh and try again. |
| 422 | `validation_failed` | The given data was invalid. |
| 429 | `too_many_requests` | Too many requests. Please slow down. |
| 500 | `server_error` | An unexpected error occurred. |
| 503 | `service_unavailable` | The service is temporarily unavailable. |

Domain code raises `App\Exceptions\ApiException` (for example `ApiException::conflict('Voucher code already reserved.', 'voucher_code_reserved')`). Its message is shown to the client, so it must never contain secrets, PII or another tenant's data.

## Health

Captured 2026-10-23 against local MySQL + Redis (predis), Laravel 13.38, PHP 8.4.

### `GET /api/v1/health` — liveness

Public. No dependency checks. Use it for process liveness.

**Request**

```bash
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```

**Response 200**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-RateLimit-Limit: 3
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 2
X-Request-Id: 01a168bc-3180-72b7-b3eb-05b0fd701ba4

{"status":"ok","service":"shopbonus-api","time":"2026-10-23T12:28:46+00:00"}
```

(The capture used `API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=3`, which is why the limit shows as 3.)

**Response 405** (wrong method)

```bash
curl -i -X POST -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```

```http
HTTP/1.0 405 Method Not Allowed
Allow: GET, HEAD
X-Request-Id: 01a168bc-40c7-7329-ab27-cb1f1a89d354
Content-Type: application/json

{"error":{"status":405,"code":"method_not_allowed","message":"This method is not allowed for the requested resource.","request_id":"01a168bc-40c7-7329-ab27-cb1f1a89d354"}}
```

**Response 429** (rate limited)

```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
Retry-After: 43
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1792758586
X-Request-Id: 01a168bc-72ce-7350-8cbb-acff7fa4bd42
Content-Type: application/json

{"error":{"status":429,"code":"too_many_requests","message":"Too many requests. Please slow down.","request_id":"01a168bc-72ce-7350-8cbb-acff7fa4bd42"}}
```

### `GET /api/v1/health/ready` — readiness

Public. Checks the database, the cache store and, when cache or queue use Redis, Redis. Returns 200 if all pass, 503 if any fail. Per-component `checks` appear only when `X-Health-Token` matches `HEALTH_READINESS_TOKEN`. Failure causes are logged server-side (exception class only) and never returned.

**Request: public, no detail**

```bash
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/ready
```

**Response 200**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-RateLimit-Limit: 3
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 1
X-Request-Id: 01a168bc-3211-72f2-84a1-1256bea9be95

{"status":"ok"}
```

**Request: monitoring, with detail and a caller-supplied request ID**

```bash
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Health-Token: <HEALTH_READINESS_TOKEN>' \
  -H 'X-Request-Id: ops-probe-20261023-01' \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/ready
```

**Response 200**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-RateLimit-Limit: 3
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-Request-Id: ops-probe-20261023-01

{"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok","cache":"ok","redis":"ok"}}
```

**Response 503** (captured with `DB_DATABASE` pointing to a database that does not exist)

```http
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
Content-Type: application/json
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 56
X-Request-Id: 01a168bc-7fad-73f8-a660-43253d40b85d

{"status":"fail","checks":{"database":"fail","cache":"ok","redis":"ok"}}
```

Without the token, the same failure returns only `{"status":"fail"}`.

## Shared error responses not yet produced by a real endpoint

No endpoint returns these statuses yet. The bodies below were rendered through the real application kernel on 2026-10-23 using temporary routes, so they are actual renderer output. Replace them with per-endpoint captures once B02 (auth) adds real endpoints.

```text
401 {"error":{"status":401,"code":"unauthenticated","message":"Authentication is required.","request_id":"01a168bd-f864-70ce-9573-0f6c6905e5fb"}}
403 {"error":{"status":403,"code":"forbidden","message":"You are not allowed to perform this action.","request_id":"01a168bd-f891-71fa-b745-e681283411ee"}}
404 {"error":{"status":404,"code":"not_found","message":"The requested resource was not found.","request_id":"01a168bc-4082-739c-a3cb-1995636d37a5"}}
