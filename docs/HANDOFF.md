## Environment / migrations / config

- Local: PHP 8.4.17, MySQL (`root`, no password) with DBs `shopbonus` and `shopbonus_testing`, Redis 127.0.0.1:6379 via predis (D-004).
- **Local Redis is shared with other projects.** Only delete keys matching `shopbonus-*` (databases 0 and 1). Never `FLUSHDB`/`FLUSHALL`; see the incident note below.
- Migrations applied locally: Laravel defaults, `personal_access_tokens`, `2026_10_23_130000/130100` (audit, errors), `2026_10_23_140000..140300` (identity), `2026_10_23_150000` (webshops, memberships, platform roles), `2026_10_23_160000` (invitations), `2026_10_23_170000` (business profiles, verifications, ownership columns), `2026_10_23_180000` (agreements), `2026_10_23_190000` (connections, webhook events), `2026_10_23_200000` (orders, order events), `2026_10_23_210000` (offers, offer versions), `2026_10_23_220000` (voucher codes, batches, vouchers, events), `2026_10_23_230000` (contact suppressions, opportunities, outbox; order customer_key/consent), `2026_10_23_240000` (integration clients, inbound events, opportunity events, voucher claims, claim reminders).
- Env key names added in B02: `LEGAL_TERMS_VERSION`, `LEGAL_PRIVACY_VERSION`, `LEGAL_MARKETING_CONSENT_VERSION` (empty = registration disabled), `SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS`, `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE` (true in prod), `SESSION_SAME_SITE`, `VERIFICATION_CODE_TTL_MINUTES`, `VERIFICATION_CODE_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `VERIFICATION_RESEND_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`. B07: `ANSWER24_DISPATCH_ENABLED` (false), `ANSWER24_CONTACT_PATH` / `ANSWER24_CANCEL_PATH` / `ANSWER24_CLAIM_STATUS_PATH` (Shopbonus-defined defaults), `ANSWER24_BASE_URL`, `ANSWER24_SIGNING_SECRET` (secret), `ANSWER24_ALLOW_LEGITIMATE_INTEREST` (false), `ANSWER24_RECENT_CONTACT_DAYS` (30). B06: `DIRECT_REWARD_FEE_BPS` (3000). B05: `BUSINESS_TIMEZONE` (default Europe/Amsterdam), `BROADCAST_CONNECTION` (null by default). B04: `WEBHOOK_PAYLOAD_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 14). B03c: `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` (secret; empty = manual entry only). Earlier: `FRONTEND_URL`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `CORS_SUPPORTS_CREDENTIALS`, `API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, `HEALTH_READINESS_TOKEN` (secret).
- Capturing docs: run the server with `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync MAIL_MAILER=log`, read codes/tokens from `storage/logs/laravel.log`, then **truncate that log**, since it holds live codes and reset tokens.

## Conventions to reuse

- Routes: `routes/api.php` v1 group. Private routes go inside `auth:sanctum` + `account.active`, and inside `verified` unless the email-verification flow itself needs them. Declare `x-access` per operation in `docs/api/openapi.yaml`; `OpenApiCoverageTest` enforces docs, examples and access matching.
- Errors: `ApiException` (supports `$details` and `$headers`). Audit: `AuditLogger::record()` in transactions, `recordSafely()` otherwise. Append-only models: `use App\Models\Concerns\AppendOnly`.
- Public IDs: models exposed to clients get a ULID `public_id` (`HasUlids` + `uniqueIds()`); never expose integer keys.
- Session-flow tests: `use Tests\Concerns\BrowsesLikeSpa` and `$this->spa('POST', ...)`.
- Index names over 64 characters fail on MySQL only: give composite indexes explicit short names.

## Incident note (2026-10-23)

While capturing docs, an early script ran `redis-cli FLUSHDB` on local Redis **database 0 twice**. Database 0 may have held other local projects' data, which would be lost. Database 1 (other projects' cache keys) was not touched. The capture script now deletes only `shopbonus-*` keys.

## Blockers / open decisions

- OPEN-SIGNUP-ENUMERATION (new), OPEN-AFFILIATE-CREDIT-TIMING, OPEN-REWARD-UNITS, OPEN-FINANCIAL-LEGAL, OPEN-MARKETING-CONSENT, OPEN-PROVIDER-CAPABILITIES, OPEN-EMPTY-CARD-27 (see `docs/DECISIONS.md`). None block B03.
- No git remote (CI unverified); no staging (p95 unverified).

## Workspace conventions (B03a)

- Workspace-scoped routes: `Route::prefix('workspaces/{workspace}')->middleware('workspace')`, plus `->middleware('workspace.can:<permission>')` per route. Read the webshop from `CurrentWorkspace`, never from input. Declare `x-permission` in OpenAPI.
- Non-member access is a generic 404 (and audited by the resolver); members lacking a permission get 403.
- Commercial routes (offers, vouchers, integrations, payments) must add `workspace.commercial` after `workspace`.
- Tests needing a commercially active webshop: `use Tests\Concerns\CreatesActiveWebshops` → `$this->activeWebshop($owner)`.
- Fees: always `FeeCalculator` (never inline percentages).
- Vouchers: only through `VoucherInventory` (reserve with an idempotency key such as `order:<id>:offer:<id>` or `answer24-handoff:<ref>`). Never update voucher/code status directly.
- Bulk inserts that bypass Eloquent must generate `public_id` with `strtolower((string) Str::ulid())`.
- Tests that commit real rows (concurrency) must use DatabaseTruncation **and** truncate in tearDown (see `ConcurrentReservationTest`).
- Partner (server-to-server) routes: `->middleware('integration.signed:<scope>')`, declared `x-access: integration` with `security: [{ integrationSignature: [] }]`. Credentials only via `php artisan shopbonus:create-integration-client`. Tests sign with `App\Support\SignatureV1::header()` (see `Answer24ChannelTest::signed()`).
- Claim links: only through `App\Services\Answer24\ClaimLinks` (handoff/accept/reminder/expire). Outbox delivery only through `OutboxDispatcher` (`shopbonus:dispatch-outbox`).
- Admin routes: inside the `admin` prefix group (`platform:super_admin`); mutations inside `password.recent`. Test them with a stateful session (`Referer`/`Origin` headers + `withSession(['auth.password_confirmed_at' => time()])`).
- **Never write a denial/security audit inside a DB transaction that then throws**: it rolls back with it. Audit before the transaction, or after commit.
- Never use database `NOW()` in queries or scripts: local MySQL runs in the server's timezone while the app writes UTC. Use PHP `now()`.
- The agent shell is zsh: never name a shell variable `path` (it is tied to `PATH`). Capture scripts are bash files using `caplib.sh` (see the scratchpad pattern described in PROGRESS); keep that pattern.

## Next agent's exact first actions

1. `git status -sb && git log --oneline -8 && php artisan test` (expect 324 + 3 skipped on SQLite; 327 on MySQL).
2. Read Trello #18 (consumer discovery), #10 (consumer profile; §6 reminders are already covered by B07b) and #5 (privacy/consent parts) in `requirements/TRELLO_CARDS.md`, plus the `B08` row in `docs/TASKS.md`.
3. Expand B08 in `docs/CHECKLIST.md` before coding. Expected scope (verify against the cards):
   - public browse API for active webshops/offers (no private fields; only commercially active webshops; paginated, filterable by category);
   - consumer favourites;
   - profile read/update (first name, locale, communication preferences as consent records, never as contact permission for other channels);
   - secured email change with re-verification (moved here from B02);
   - "My vouchers" list (vouchers issued to the user, incl. Answer24 claims; code visible to the owner only);
   - data export/deletion request contracts (privacy).
4. Keep the conventions above; capture real responses for every new endpoint (`docs/api/README.md` + `openapi.yaml`).
